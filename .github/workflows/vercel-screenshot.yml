            You are tasked with capturing screenshots of the staging environment using the Playwright MCP server.

            The staging URL is: https://staging-erp.estrack.com/

            Please follow these steps:

            1. First, install the browser if needed using the mcp__playwright__browser_install tool
            2. Navigate to the staging URL using mcp__playwright__browser_navigate
            3. Take screenshots at different viewport sizes:
               - Desktop: 1920x1080 - save as screenshots/staging-desktop.png
               - Tablet: 768x1024 - save as screenshots/staging-tablet.png  
               - Mobile: 375x812 - save as screenshots/staging-mobile.png
            4. For each viewport:
               - Use mcp__playwright__browser_resize to set the viewport size
               - Use mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot to capture the screenshot with the appropriate filename
            5. Also capture a full-page screenshot at 1920x1080 as screenshots/staging-fullpage.png
            6. Create a slick marketing page including screenshots of the app, render it in playwright, save another screenshot of the full marketing page.
            6. Close the browser when done using mcp__playwright__browser_close

            Make sure all screenshots are saved in the screenshots/ directory.
            Verify the screenshots were created successfully by listing the directory contents.
